## Complete but not in repo:
- different linear regression w/ momentum
- kmeans in R
- neural networks from Andrew Ng's deep learning course (standard, LSTM, GRU, RNN)

## In Progress:
- collaborative filtering
- isolation forest

## Future possibilities:
- refactor/improve older code (kmeans, univariate linear regression)
- fix and improve older code (multivariate linear regression)

## Other Ideas:
- SVM
- Decision Tree
