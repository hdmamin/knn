## Complete but not in repo:
- neural networks from Andrew Ng's deep learning course (standard, LSTM, GRU, RNN)
- collaborative filtering (low rank matrix factorization using SGD w/ momentum)
- kmeans in R
- cleaner linear regression w/ momentum

## In Progress:
- isolation forest

## Future possibilities:
- refactor/improve old code from pre-MSDS (kmeans, linear regression, logistic regression) 
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
