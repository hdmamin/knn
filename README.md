## Complete but not yet uploaded:
- different linear regression w/ momentum
- kmeans in R
- neural networks from Andrew Ng's deep learning course (standard, LSTM, GRU, RNN)

## Future possibilities:
- refactor kmeans
- refactor linear regression
- find and refactor multivariate linear regression
- find and refactor logistic regression

## Other Ideas:
- SVM
- Decision Tree
