##  Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

To better develop an intuition for machine learning algorithms and how they work, I've worked on implementing some of them using plain Python (i.e. no scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc). Much of this was done (or at least started) when I was first learning to code, so it's interesting to look back on. Several similar projects have been completed but are excluded from the public repo as they are part of ongoing courses at the University of San Francisco or on Coursera:
  
- neural networks from Andrew Ng's deep learning course (standard, LSTM with attention, GRU, CNN)
- isolation forest (anomaly detection)
- collaborative filtering (low rank matrix factorization using SGD w/ momentum)
- K means implemented in R
- cleaner version of linear regression w/ momentum
